# Tumordetection-AI

This project is currently in progress. We are trying to develop an AI model that detects cancerous tumors in patients. This is an extensive project, and even though we have trained the Neural network model to make accurate detections, the error rate can significantly be reduced.

Feel free to make contributions :)
